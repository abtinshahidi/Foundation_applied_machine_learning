# Additional information about the course:

### There is a requirement file inside the directory named requirement_ML.txt; which include all the dependencies needed to run the notebooks in the [jupyter-lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)

### **This is the minimal dependencies for running them on the jupyter-lab**: if you don't want the jupyter-lab  you can remove it from the requirement file.

This is the guide to install dependencies in your Virtualenv:
```shell
pip install -r requirement_ML.txt
```
